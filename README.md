# ![Bloxstrap](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/raw/main/Bloxstrap/Resources/IconBloxstrap-png.png) Bloxstrap

An open, customizable, feature-packed alternative bootstrapper for Roblox.
 
## Usage
This is intended to be a seamless replacement for the stock Roblox bootstrapper, working more or less how you'd expect it to.

When you first run it, you'll see the preferences menu. If you want to configure preferences again after you've already installed it, open up Apps and Features, look for Bloxstrap and select Modify.

Bloxstrap can be uninstalled, and reverts to the stock boostrapper when uninstalled, so it's relatively harmless.
 
Please keep in mind that **Bloxstrap is in very early development**, and you'll no doubt encounter some bugs. If you do, please submit an issue!
 
## Features
Here's some of the features that Bloxstrap provides over the stock Roblox bootstrapper:

* Old death sound and mouse cursor can be permanently re-enabled
* Lets you choose where to install Roblox to
* Integration with Discord Rich Presence
* Custom bootstrapper styles (includes old versions and dark theme)
 
## Installing
Bloxstrap requires the [x86 .NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.7-windows-x86-installer). If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it when running Bloxstrap.

As of right now, Bloxstrap is only supported for Windows. Mac support is possible, but I don't currently have a Mac to test this on.

* [Roblox Studio Mod Manager](https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Studio-Mod-Manager) by [MaximumADHD](https://www.roblox.com/users/2032622/profile) - some utility code was borrowed to help with Bloxstrap's bootstrapper functionality. They're all under Bloxstrap.Helpers.RSMM, with some having slight modifications. Besides, it's a great project.
