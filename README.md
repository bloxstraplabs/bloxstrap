An open-source, feature-packed alternative bootstrapper for Roblox.

>[!NOTE]
>This a drop-in replacement for the stock Roblox bootstrapper, working more or less how you'd expect it to, while providing additional useful features. This does not touch or modify the game client itself, it's just a launcher! So don't worry, there's practically no risk of being banned for using this.

Running into a problem or need help with something? [Check out the Wiki](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/wiki). If you can't find anything, or would like to suggest something, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/issues) or report it in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nKjV3mGq6R).
 
Bloxstrap is only supported for PCs running **Windows**.
 
 ## Installing
Download the [latest release of Bloxstrap](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/releases/latest), and run it. Configure your preferences if needed, and install. That's about it!

Alternatively, you can install Bloxstrap via [Winget](https://winstall.app/apps/pizzaboxer.Bloxstrap) by running this in a Command Prompt window:
```
winget install bloxstrap
```
>[!IMPORTANT]
>You will also need the [.NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=win11-x64&apphost_version=6.0.16&gui=true). If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it anyway. Be sure to install Bloxstrap after you've installed this.

Windows Smartscreen might show a popup when you run Bloxstrap for the first time.[^1]  To dismiss it, just click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.

Once installed, Bloxstrap is added to your **Start Menu**, where you can access the settings and reconfigure your preferences if needed.
 
## Features
Here's some of the features that Bloxstrap provides over the stock Roblox bootstrapper:

* Persistent file modifications, includes re-adding the old death sound!
* Support for easy and simple FastFlag editing, no need to mess around with a JSON file.
* Painless and seamless support for Discord Rich Presence - no auth cookie needed!
* A customizable launcher look
* Lets you see what region your current server is located in
* Lets you have multiple Roblox game instances open simultaneously

All the available features are browsable through the Bloxstrap settings menu.

>[!TIP]
>Bloxstrap also only runs whenever necessary, so it doesn't stay running in the background when you're not playing.
