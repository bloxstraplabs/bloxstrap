 <h3 align="center">An open, customizable, feature-packed alternative bootstrapper for Roblox.</h4>
 
## Usage
This is intended to be a seamless replacement for the stock Roblox bootstrapper, working more or less how you'd expect it to.

When you first run it, you'll see the preferences menu. If you want to configure preferences again after you've already installed it, open up Apps and Features, look for Bloxstrap and select Modify.

Bloxstrap can be uninstalled, and reverts to the stock boostrapper when uninstalled, so it's relatively harmless.
 
Please keep in mind that **Bloxstrap is in very early development**, and you'll no doubt encounter some bugs. If you do, please submit an issue!
 
## Features
Here's some of the features that Bloxstrap provides over the stock Roblox bootstrapper:

* Bootstrapper style can be customized (including being able to emulate older version looks)
* Install location can be selected (useful if you usually install all your games on a separate drive)
* Support for the old death sound (no messing around with your install folder, and it persists on updates!)

Some more features that we hope to add include more custom styles, and Discord Rich Presence support.
 
## Installing
Bloxstrap requires the [x86 .NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.7-windows-x86-installer). If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it when running Bloxstrap.

As of right now, Bloxstrap is only supported for Windows. Mac support is possible, but I don't currently have a Mac to test this on.

## Contributions
* [Roblox Studio Mod Manager](https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Studio-Mod-Manager) by [MaximumADHD](https://www.roblox.com/users/2032622/profile) - some utility code was borrowed to help with Bloxstrap's bootstrapper functionality. They're all under Bloxstrap.Helpers.RSMM, with some having slight modifications. Besides, it's a great project.
