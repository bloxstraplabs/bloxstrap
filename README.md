Bloxstrap but it's made for Limbo, an old roblox revival.

Running into a problem or need help with something? [Check out the Wiki](https://github.com/KoutchguestAccount/limbstrap/wiki). If you can't find anything, or would like to suggest something, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/KoutchguestAccount/limbstrap/issues).
 
Limbtrap is only supported for PCs running Windows.
 
 ## Installing
Download the [latest release of Limstrap](https://github.com/KoutchguestAccount/limbstrap/releases/latest), and run it. Configure your preferences if needed, and install. That's about it!

Stuff here works like Bloxstrap, you do need to install [.NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=win11-x64&apphost_version=6.0.16&gui=true) to run this program. Also, do not worry as Limstrap will NOT overwrite Bloxstrap.
 
## Features
Limstrap provides all features Bloxstrap already does.

All the available features are browsable through the Limstrap menu.

Limbtrap also only runs whenever necessary, so it doesn't stay running in the background when you're not playing.
